		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Kantara: Chapter 1 is set in the past and shows the time of a kingdom that rules over many villages. The king and his people come to the forest area and learn about the village god and its power. At first, the kingdom tries to control the land and its people. They also try to take the village god and place it under their rule. The villagers believe their god cannot be owned or moved. A promise is made between the king and the spirit to protect the land. Over time, this promise is broken, leading to fear and conflict. This chapter explains how the fight between the kingdom and the village belief first began.</p>

		<h2>Parts to pay attention too</h2> 
		<p>Pay attention to these details:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>When the main character goes closer to people in power or authority, he wears a shirt. This shows respect and a need to fit into their rules. When he returns to his own people and land, he removes the shirt, showing comfort, freedom, and trust in his roots.</li>
		<li>Around officials and outsiders, he stays more controlled and alert. In his village and forest, his movements are relaxed, showing he truly belongs there.</li>
		<li>When the main character is dealing with officials or outside spaces, he often wears footwear. In the forest and during rituals, he is barefoot. This shows his connection to the land and respect for tradition, as well as the clear line between modern rules and ancestral ways.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This detail shows that the land is not just a place to him but something sacred and personal. It is important because it highlights how his identity is tied to tradition, not to modern rules or authority. I love how the people that made this paid attention to little details like this because many often forget but it allows people to get absorbed into the movie easier. </p>
